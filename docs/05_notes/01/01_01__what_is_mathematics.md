# What is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods

> Second Edition  
> Richard Courant, Herbert Robbins  


## 0. Preface

Formal mathematics is like spelling and grammar - a matter of the correct application of local rules.  
Meaningful mathematics is like journalism - it tells an interesting story. Unlike some journalism, the story has to be true.  
The best mathematics is like literature - it brings a story to life before your eyes and involves you in it, intellectually and emotionally.  

Before 19th Century: what the mathematical entities (point, lines, numbers, ...) "actually" are?  
After 19th Century: understanding the structures and relationships among "undefined objects".  
(two points determine a line, numbers combine according to certain rules to form other numbers)
