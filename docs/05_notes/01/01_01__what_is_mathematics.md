# What is Mathematics? An Elementary Approach to Ideas and Methods

> Second Edition  
> Richard Courant, Herbert Robbins  


## 0. Preface

Formal mathematics is like spelling and grammar - a matter of the correct application of local rules.  
Meaningful mathematics is like journalism - it tells an interesting story. Unlike some journalism, the story has to be true.  
The best mathematics is like literature - it brings a story to life before your eyes and involves you in it, intellectually and emotionally.  

Before 19th Century: what the mathematical entities (point, lines, numbers, ...) "actually" are?  
After 19th Century: understanding the structures and relationships among "undefined objects".  
(two points determine a line, numbers combine according to certain rules to form other numbers)  



## 1. The Natural Numbers

> All mathematical statements should be reducible ultimately to statements about the natural numbers.  
> Numbers are an abstract concept, having no reference to the individual characteristics of the objects counted.  
> Begins by accepting the natural numbers as given, together with the 2 fundamental operations, addition and multiplication.  


### 1.1. Calculation with Integers

**1. Laws of Arithmetic**  

- Natural numbers = positive integers  
- Arithmetic: mathematical theory of the natural numbers  
- 5 fundamental laws of arithmetic  
    $$a, b, c$$: natural numbers  
    Commutative law of addition: $$a + b = b + a$$  
    Commutative law of multiplication: $$ab = ba$$  
    Associative law of addition: $$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$$  
    Associative law of multiplication: $$a(bc) = (ab)c$$  
    Distributive law: $$a(b + c) = ab + ac$$  
- Inequality ($$<, >$$)  
    The statements $$a < b$$ ($$a$$ is less than $$b$$) and $$b > a$$ ($$b$$ is greater than $$a$$) are equivalent.  
    This means that there exists a natural number $$c$$ such that $$b = a + c$$.  
- Subtraction ($$-$$)  
    When $$b > a$$ and $$b = a + c$$, subtraction is defined as $$c = b - a$$  
    Addition and subtraction are inverse operations: $$(a + d) - d = a$$  
- The integer zero ($$0$$)  
    Zero is a special integer defined by the following arithmetic properties.  
    $$a + 0 = a$$  
    $$a \cdot 0 = 0$$  
    $$a - a = 0$$
