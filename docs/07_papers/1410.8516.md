> **TLDR**: maximize exact log-likelihood via a change of variables, using a carefully designed invertible transformation with a tractable Jacobian.  



## 1. Intuition & Motivation

Using a variational lower bound criterion might yield a suboptimal solution with respect to the true log-likelihood.  
How can we maximize exact log-likelihood?  
If we make $$D_{KL} \left (q_{\phi}(z \mid x) \parallel p_{\theta}(z \mid x) \right ) = 0$$, then the variational lower bound is same as log-likelihood.  
→ design inference network as inverse of generator.  



## 2. Learning Bijective Transformations of Continuous Probabilities
### 2.1. Approach Overview

Train encoder $$f$$ using NICE critertion.  
Use decoder $$f^{-1}$$ to generate samples.  


### 2.2. Non-linear Independent Components Estimation (NICE)

Maximum likelihood using the change of variable formula.  
Learn an invertible non-linear transformation $$f$$, which transforms the data distribution into a simple distribution.  
Assume that prior distribution $$p_H(h)$$ is factorial.  

$$h = f(x)$$  
$$p_X(x) \ dx = p_H(h) \ dh$$  
$$p_X(x) = p_H(f(x)) \left | \mathrm{det} (\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}) \right |$$  
$$\mathrm{log} (p_X(x)) = \mathrm{log}(p_H(f(x))) + \mathrm{log} (\left | \mathrm{det} (\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}) \right |)$$  
$$\mathrm{log} (p_X(x)) = \sum_{d=1}^{D} \mathrm{log}(p_{H_d}(f_d(x))) + \mathrm{log} (\left | \mathrm{det} (\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}) \right |)$$  

Prior term ($$\mathrm{log}(p_H(f(x)))$$): encourage the transformed data distribution $$f(x)$$ to match the prior distribution $$p_H$$.  
Entropy term ($$\mathrm{log} (\left | \mathrm{det} (\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}) \right |)$$): compensates for the local volume change induced by $$f$$, ensuring proper density transformation from $$p_X$$ to $$p_H$$.  


### 2.3. Architecture

How can we design $$f$$ so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial?  
Considering flexible design, use bijective transformation with triangular Jacobian.  


**Coupling Layer**  
Keywords: partition $$x$$, function $$m$$, coupling law $$g$$.  

$$y_{I_1} = x_{I_1}$$  
$$y_{I_2} = g(x_{I_2}; m(x_{I_1}))$$  
$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \begin{bmatrix} I_d & 0 \\ \frac{\partial y_{I_2}}{\partial x_{I_1}} & \frac{\partial y_{I_2}}{\partial x_{I_2}} \\ \end{bmatrix}$$  

Jacobian: $$\mathrm{det} \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = \mathrm{det} \frac{\partial y_{I_2}}{\partial x_{I_2}}$$  
Inverse: $$x_{I_1} = y_{I_1}, x_{I_2} = g^{-1}(y_{I_2}; m(y_{I_1}))$$  

Additive coupling law: $$g(a;b) = a+b$$  
Multiplicative coupling law: $$g(a;b) = a \odot b$$  
Affine coupling law: $$g(a;b) = a \odot b_1 + b_2$$  

For numerical stability, use additive coupling layer.  


**Combining Coupling Layer**  
Compose several coupling layers to obtain a more complex layered transformation.  
Since a coupling layer leaves part of its input unchanged, exchange the role of the two subsets in the partition in alternating layers, so that the composition of two coupling layers modifies every dimension.  


**Rescaling**  
Since additive coupling lyaer has unit Jacobian determinant, include a diagonal scaling matrix $$S$$ as the top layer.  
This allows the model to give more weight on some dimensions and less in others.  

$$\mathrm{log} (p_X(x)) = \sum_{d=1}^{D} [\mathrm{log}(p_{H_d}(f_d(x))) + \mathrm{log} (|S_{dd}|)]$$  

Scaling factors are related with eigenspectrum of PCA.  
- If $$S_{dd}$$ is large 
  = volume of dimension $$d$$ has to be expanded to match prior distribution  
  = variance of dimension $$d$$ is small  
  = dimension $$d$$ has less information  
  = eigenvalue is small  
- If $$S_{dd}$$ is small  
  = volume of dimension $$d$$ has to be contracted to match prior distribution  
  = variance of dimension $$d$$ is large  
  = dimension $$d$$ has more information  
  = eigenvalue is large  


### 2.4. Inpainting

$$x = (x_{obs}, x_{miss})$$  
$$i$$: iteration  
$$\alpha_i = \frac{10}{100 + i}$$: step size  
$$\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)$$  

Stochastic gradient update the $$x_{miss}$$  
$$x_{miss, \ i+1} = x_{miss, \ i} + \alpha_i (\frac{\partial \mathrm{log}(p_X((x_{obs}, x_{miss, \ i})))}{\partial x_{miss, \ i}} + \epsilon)$$
