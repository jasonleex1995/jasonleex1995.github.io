## 1. Intuition & Motivation

Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD): detect anomalies without any training sample in a target dataset  

For ZSAD, previous works exploit the CLIP's generalizability by using specialized object-aware text prompts.  
For example, WinCLIP use a large number of hand-crafted text prompts for ZSAD.  

<img width="80%" alt="Figure1_comparison" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c11fe77-40ab-4125-9776-e0735ef93c0b">

However, the current prompting approaches fail to capture the abnormality as shown in `Figure 1 (c), (d), (e)`.  
Why?  
Since CLIP is pre-trained to align with the class semantics of the foreground objects, CLIP with object-aware prompt will also focus on foreground semantics rather than abnormality/normality in the images.  
Natural question may follow: **do we need foreground object semantics in ZSAD?**  

Even though the foreground object semantics can be completely different, anomaly patterns remain quite similar.  
Thus, it is natural to learn object-agnostic text prompts, not object-aware text prompts.  

Then how can we make CLIP to not focus on object semantics?  
The most simple approach would be excluding the object semantics from text prompt templates.  
(ex. `A photo of a damaged [class]` → `A photo of a damaged [object]`)  



## 2. AnomalyCLIP: object-agnostic prompt learning

### 2.1. Approach overview

- Core method: object-agnostic text prompt templates  
- Training objective: cross-entropy, focal, dice loss  
  image-level (global): cross-entropy loss  
  pixel-level (local): focal loss, dice loss
- Other methods: text prompt tuning, DPAM  
  text prompt tuning: learnable token embeddings in text encoder  
  DPAM: replace Q-K self-attention with diagonally prominent attention (ex. V-V self-attention)  
- **Only train text prompt templates and token embeddings**  


### 2.2. Object-agnostic text prompt design

- Object-aware text prompt templates (previous works)  
  text embeddings of normality: `[V_1][V_2]...[V_E][cls]`  
  text embeddings of abnormality: `[W_1][W_2]...[W_E][damaged][cls]`  

- **Object-agnostic text prompt templates (our work)**  
  text embeddings of normality ($g_n$): `[V_1][V_2]...[V_E][object]`  
  text embeddings of abnormality ($g_a$): `[W_1][W_2]...[W_E][damaged][object]`  


### 2.3. Refinement of the textual space

Use text prompt tuning to refine the original textual space of CLIP.  
Following the previous works ([VPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12119), [MaPLe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03117)), add additional learnable token embeddings into its text encoder.  


### 2.4. Refinement of the local visual space
<img width="80%" alt="Figure3_attention_vis" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3475246d-6165-4cf3-a43a-388a4413fafe">

Attention map in the visual encoder focuses on the specific tokens.  
(ex. `Figure 1 (b)`)  
These tokens disrupt the local visual semantics, hindering the effective learning of the fine-grained abnormality.  

Authors empirically find that a Diagonally Prominent Attention Map (DPAM) helps reduce the disturbance from other tokens, leading to improved local visual semantics.  
Thus, replace the original Q-K attention in the visual encoder with diagonally prominent attention.  
(ex. Q-Q, K-K, V-V self-attention)  


### 2.5. Training and inference
#### **Training**
<img width="80%" alt="Equation2_loss" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55dd1ed-c105-4f3b-a520-1ae2eaa92a5e">

Objective: glocal loss (global + local)  
Global loss: cross-entropy loss  
Local loss: focal loss, dice loss  

Integrate intermediate layers to provide more local visual details.  


#### **Inference**

- Image-level anomaly score: $P(g_a, f_i)$  
  $P(\cdot, \cdot)$: similarity score used in CLIP  
  $g_a$: learned abnormality text embeddings  
  $f_i$: global visual embedding

- Pixel-level prediction: merge the segmentation of all selected intermediate layers with interpolation and smoothing operation

Compared to V-V self-attention,  
Q-Q self-attention performas similar on pixel-level anomalies, but degrades on image-level anomalies.  
K-K self-attention performas similar on image-level anomalies, but degrades on pixel-level anomalies.
